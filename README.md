## About this Laravel Project

A project in Laravel - Imager - is a project that enables the sending of photos.

The idea is for the simple user to create an account and send photos through it, where the admin can then view, download and give status related to those photos.

The simple user can also use the coupons that enable the price reduction.

Price - Several functions have been created that depending on the amount of photos, the price also varies.

Coupon codes - Created by the admin, with a certain value, can be used only once and allows the customer to deduct depending on the price of the coupon (by the administrator).
